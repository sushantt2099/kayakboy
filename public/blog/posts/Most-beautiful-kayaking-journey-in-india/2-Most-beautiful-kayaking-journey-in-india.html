        <p>In recent times the internet has helped us to discover many new sports, say it kayaking, surfing, wakeboarding, rafting etc. Like all these sports, the word "kayak" is alien to many of us in India.</p>

        <p>After we discover new sports, many of us want to live it. We Indian have started to catch up with other countries in adventure sports.</p>

        <p>Until now it was not possible to go on a kayak journey in South India.</p>

        <p>A good kayaking experience requires a beautiful river, fresh air, proper gears and a responsible Instructor. Finding all of them together will certainly create the most memorable experience one can have.</p>

        <p>River Shambhavi offers everything to live that kayakers dream. Except for monsoon season, river Shambhavi is calm throughout the year, she is like a long beautiful lake, surrounded by coconut and tropical green trees. River Shambhavi got her name from her calm nature.</p>

        <p>How many of us have the opportunity to stay in the water for a whole day? or to camp near the river bank, do barbeque, play music? You get to do all of this when you come and do this beautiful kayaking journey.</p>

        <p>I offer a trip which is divided between two days. It starts from Mulki, we paddle whole day on day 1, camp near the river bank, eat authentic Mangalorean food.</p>

        <p><a href="/kayaking_trip/explore/explore.html">Click for deatils about this trip.</a> Come to Mulki, Mangalore to experience it first hand.</p>

        <p>I have done this route for more than 15 times. This is the most beautiful kayaking journey one can travel. River Shambhavi is always exciting, always happy, always beautiful.</p>
